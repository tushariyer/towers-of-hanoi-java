# towers-of-hanoi-java
A short java program that uses stacks to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem. A user can specify how many rings there are to sort.

This was done as a Java project for a computing fundamentals class. Unfortunately, the package is a BlueJ package, so you'll need to extract the files and then run them after you create a new project in Netbeans/Eclipse or whatever java sdk interface you prefer. I will build it soon so that you can just run the .jar file.
